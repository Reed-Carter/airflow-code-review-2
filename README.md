# code-review-airflow-2

#### By [Reed Carter](https://github.com/Reed-Carter)

#### This repo is a code review to demonstrate an understanding of using airflow to orchestrate a series of events using decorators, file sensors, and XComs. It senses when a CSV file is uploaded into the data folder which triggers the code to determine the classes favorite type of ice cream.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Go to https://github.com/Reed-Carter/code-review-airflow-2 to find the specific repository for this website.

* Then clone the repository by inputting: 
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Reed-Carter/code-review-airflow-2
  ```
* Go into the new directory:
  ```bash
  cd Airflow-Practice
  ```
* Once in the directory run the setup file in order to create a virtual environment, install airflow on the virtual environment, and install all required dependencies using the command:
  ```bash
  ./setup.sh
  ```
* Since the required directories are already in place, set your user id as the $AIRFLOW_UID in a .env file:
  ```bash
  echo -e "AIRFLOW_UID=$(id -u)\nAIRFLOW_GID=0" > .env
  ```
* Now airflow can be initializaed with:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up airflow-init
  ```
* if you run `docker ps -a` you should see running containers
* Now the remaining containers can be started using:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```
* Leave this running, and open a new terminal tab to use the command line.
* Navigate to http://0.0.0.0:8080/home in your browser and loging as the default user `airflow` with the password also `airflow`.
